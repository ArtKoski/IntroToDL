Max pooling is used in convolutional NNs to reduce the spatial dimensionality (or 'downsample the feature maps'), while holding on to the most important features. In the network architecture, a max pooling layer it is often placed after a convolutional layer. It can help computational efficiency and reduce overfitting.

The concept goal is (imo) similar to PCA (i.e., dimensionality reduction).
